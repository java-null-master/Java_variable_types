# Java_variable_types
A variable provides us with named storage that our programs can manipulate.
Each variable in Java has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; 
the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
You must declare all variables before they can be used.


'''
int a, b, c;         // Declares three ints, a, b, and c.
int a = 10, b = 10;  // Example of initialization
byte B = 22;         // initializes a byte type variable B.
double pi = 3.14159; // declares and assigns a value of PI.
char a = 'a';        // the char variable a iis initialized with value 'a'
